               Morris Traversal : Pre Order Traversal without Stack 
        
        1. Initialize current as root 
        2. While current is not NULL
        
            If current does not have left child
                a) Print currentâ€™s data
                b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
             Else
                a) Move to Left Subtree.
                b) Reach to the predecessor - whose right is not NULL and which is not current
                c) If predecessor has a right, that means, we made the link before, so this time remove the link, after moving right.
                d) If predecessor doesn;t have a right, make it's right connection to the current, ...PRINT...,and move to left of current.
               
               NOTE: The algorithm for Morris Traversal for Inorder and PreOrder is the same, except that there is an
               extra visiting condition in the PreOrder case after making predecesssor's right connection.
               
               
               OTHER WORDS:
               
               1. If left child is NULL, Visit the current. Move Right.
               2. If Left child is not NULL,
                    a. Check if moving right comes back to current. In this case, remove predecessor's right.
                    b. If you reach a node while moving right whose right is null, this is the predecessor. 
                        Make its right point to current. Print Current,  and move left.
